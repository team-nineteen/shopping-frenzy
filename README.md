# shopping-frenzy

Shopping Frenzy is a game about a little kid who has to go shopping for their mother who is sick.
However, during these times, the store is a bit of a chaos. The goal is to scavenge all the items on the grocery list that your mom gave you and bring them with you in your grocery cart.

Use your surroundings to get up to high places and sneak into hidden areas to find secrets.
The less time and money you spend, the better your score!
Enjoy!
